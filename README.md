#Computer Security Related Programs in Python

There are a lot of instances when studying Computer Security that you need to encrypt or decrypt messages for a given assignment. In this repository, I am collecting any such programs that I need to make for my course.

For your convinience, here is a list of all the scripts that are present in their repository along with their description and file names.

* **Frequency Analysis** (frequency-analysis.py) - This script performs a frequency analysis on the given text. It reads its data from a file present inside a folder called text.
* **Hex To Binary Conversion** (hex-to-binary.py) - As the name suggests, this script basically performs a hexadecimal to binary conversion for a given hexadecimal message. 
* **Mono Alphabetic Substitution** (monoalphabetic-substitution.py) - This script performs mono alphabetic substitution based on a fixed key. It basically performs a shift encryption on the given text message, shifting it based on the provided key.
* **Substitution Cipher** (substitution-cipher.py) - This script performs a monoalphabetic substitution as well, but instead of following a fixed value, it follows a given function. It also has a part commented out right now that allows you to perform a poly-alphabetic substitution based on the position of the alphabet. It has different functions for odd and even place alphabets.
* **Vigenere Cipher** (vigenere.py) - This script performs the Vigenere Encryption on the given plaintext along with the given key. It makes use of the substituiton function given under the Vigenere Encryption.
